# Overview
This repository contains the resources for building motion planning algorithms for an art installation masterpiece led by Professor Michelle Lopez. The project aims to utilize the Stewart Platform—a robot with a parallel structure—to express unique insights into social media influence through interactive motion.

The Stewart Platform is a parallel robot structure consisting of a fixed base and multiple arms connected to a movable platform. Its design allows for precise movement in six degrees of freedom, offering flexibility and accuracy in motion control. With suitable control algorithms, the platform can execute complex movements with precision.

Currently, the project is under the guidance of Professor Mark Yim, Director of the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
